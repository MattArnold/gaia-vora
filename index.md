# A board game by Nemo Rathwald, designer of "Overworld"
## 2 to 4 players
## 40 to 60 minutes
## Ages 12 and up

Rotate the planet board & select a weather figure to use its action on the land beneath it, to fill the desolate planet of Gaia with verdant life. Arrange your carnivores, herbivores, and plants, to eat your opponents, and survive on the highest stacks of land tiles. But beware Vora, the Feastmoon!
