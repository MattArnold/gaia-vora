## OBJECTIVE

On the barren Planet of Gaia, players are creating lush verdant lands, and giving rise to Life-Forms which come in three Species: CarniVores, HerbiVores, and Plants. But the swollen Moon, named Vora, gazes hungrily from the night sky. It is jealous of Gaia’s life, and influences Species to eat each other!

The objective of the game is for your Life-Forms to:

- Eat the Life-Forms of your opponents,
- Survive to the end of the game without being eaten or killed.
- Stand on top of many layers of Tiles.

The central rule is: **Life-Forms of the same species may not share the same Tile, or the Water.**

The biggest Tile is Planet Carousel itself, which is one big Water Tile. The Water, as well as each stack of Land Tiles, may only have one CarniVore, one HerbiVore, and one Plant standing on its exposed surface.

At the end of the game, you want your Life-Forms to live at high altitudes atop stacks of Tiles. Land Tiles may not stack on top of other Tiles of the same color. And so the highest possible altitude is a stack of one Snow Tile, one Grass Tile, one Sand Tile, one Stone Tile, and the Water of the Planet Carousel itself. At game end, these five layers would confer five points to each Life-Form standing atop that stack, which is the maximum that any Life-Form can be worth.

## SETUP

Stack the Planet Carousel on the Sky Board. Insert the wooden dowel Peg through the holes in both layers so that the Planet Carousel can rotate on the Sky Board.

Place the Carousel in a random rotation at the start of the game. Take the ratchet-stopping flap which is shaped like a cloud. Insert its tab into the slot on the Sky Board. This ensures that the planet Carousel can only rotate clockwise.

The game comes with Tiles called “Land Tiles” in four colors: 4 grey Stone, 4 yellow Sand, 4 green Grass, and 3 white Snow. The Planet has eight sawteeth around its edge. Each land Tile is shaped like a pie slice that covers 1/8 of the Planet and aligns with one sawtooth.

Cover all the Water around the perimeter of the Planet with Stone and Sand Tiles, alternating.

Set aside the Snow and Grass Tiles within reach of the players.

The Sky Objects are printed on the Sky spaces on the Sky Board, in this order, clockwise: Rainbow, Sun, empty Sky space, Storm, empty Sky space, Meteor, Moon. (The remaining Sky space contains the cardboard cloud flap which stops the planet from rotating counter-clockwise.)

Each player has 12 Life-Form Figures in their color: 3 CarniVores, 4 HerbiVores, and 5 Plants.

Each player has a Reference Card with a border in their color, with diagrams showing what the Sky Objects do. The Card also has a section showing buried Fossils; this Fossil area is where players will keep Life-Forms from their opponents which they have killed.

Each player places their Life-Forms on the table in front of them. This is their Reincarnation Pool.

*For a 2-player game, set up the Reference Card and Reincarnation Pool for a third player color, the Bot. The Bot never takes any turns or makes any decisions, but its Life-Forms are available to place on the Planet using the Rainbow. If the Moon causes players’ Life-Forms to be eaten by the Bot’s Life-Forms, they go on the Bot’s Reference Card. The Bot cannot win the game.*

## TAKING A TURN

1. Roll the die and rotate the planet.
2. Optionally spend Stars to rotate the planet more.
3. Activate a corner of the board: the Sun, Rainbow, Storm, or Meteor.

Players take turns in clockwise order. 

1. Roll the die and rotate the planet.

To take your turn, roll the die. It bears these sides: 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3. Rotate the Planet a number of steps equal to the number on the die. Each step trips the ratchet-stopper once.

2. Optionally spend Stars to rotate the planet more.

You may rotate the planet 1 additional ratchet stop for each Star you return to the game box. You begin the game with four Stars. Once spent, Stars are gone for the rest of the game, so use them carefully!

4. Activate a corner of the board: the Sun, Rainbow, Storm, or Meteor.

Each Sky Object has a different power. Activate its power on the Tile beneath it. Life-forms are born under the Rainbow and the Sun, migrate out from under the Storm, and get blown up when the Meteor drops a Tile on them. But you may only activate one of these Sky Objects per turn. See the following section for how to activate the power of the Sky Object you chose.

(You may not select the Moon, because the Moon always activates its power no matter what you choose. Life Forms only eat each other under the Moon, which will be discussed later.)

*You are not allowed to select a Sky Object whose activation would cause nothing to change. If all of them would change nothing in their current positions, you may move one. We'll talk about moving them soon.*

If the Sky Object you chose is above Water, it affects the entire uncovered surface of the Planet Carousel, because that is one big Water Tile.

After resolving the Sky Object you chose, play passes to the next player.

The game is over at the end of the turn when all the Snow and Grass Tiles are on the Planet (See “Scoring”.)

### THE SUN OR THE RAINBOW

If you chose to activate the Sun or Rainbow, add Life-Forms (CarniVores, HerbiVores, or Plants) to the Planet: one on the Tile directly under the Sun, and one on the visible surface of each Tile touching that Tile, including Water.

If using the Sun, all three Life-Forms must be your own color. If using the Rainbow, all three Life-Forms must be in different colors.

**Each Tile may only have one of each species standing on it.** *That means you might not place the maximum possible number of Life-Forms, if there is not room.*

*The uncovered surface of the Planet Carousel is one big Water Tile, connected through the center of the Planet Carousel. So, check if any the Water already contains the species you are trying to add to the Water.*

### THE STORM

If you chose to activate the Storm, move all Life-Forms out of the Tile under the Storm. Move them into any Tiles that Tile is next to, which may include Water. (The Water is next to everything.)

*This is a world where plants can walk.*

*A Life-Form may not move onto a Tile which already has its species.*

*It may always move onto the uncovered Water surface of the Planet Carousel, if its species is not already there.*

*You must move the Plant, and the HerbiVore, and the CarniVore, even if you do not want to move all of them.*

### METEOR

When you activate the Meteor, you will stack a Tile onto the location under the Meteor.

A. It may be a Snow or Grass Land Tile which is off the board.

B. It may be a Tile, or stack of Tiles, which are sitting directly on the Water of the Planet, and all the Life-forms standing on it (which are carried along).

You may not create a stack with duplicates of the same Tile.

The Life-Forms which were standing on the Tile where this Tile landed are all killed by this Tile falling on them. The killed Life-Forms go onto the Fossil area on the Reference Card of the player whose turn it is.

Water is an exception: Life-Forms in the Water will always swim into the center of the Planet, gather around the Axle Peg, and survive the Meteor dropping a Tile on Water.

### THE MOON

The player may not choose to activate the Moon. Instead, it activates itself to cause Eating in the location under it, at all times, on every turn. Players do not get a choice about the Moon’s effect.

Whenever CarniVores or HerbiVores are beneath the Moon, they immediately attempt to Eat! As long as they are NOT under the Moon, a CarniVore peacefully co-exists with a HerbiVore, and a HerbiVore co-exists with a Plant. But the Planet’s rotation steadily advances these peaceful locations clockwise, closer and closer to the Moon, where Eating occurs:

The player who owns the HerbiVore (if any) awards its player with ownership of the Plant (if any). Then the player who owns the CarniVore (if any) awards its player with ownership of the HerbiVore (if any).

*Plants do not eat anything. Nothing eats CarniVores; they cannot be eaten. *

When any player’s Life-Forms eat another Life-Form, the eaten Life-Form is awarded to the player whose color did the eating, even if that is not the player whose turn it is. The player whose Life-Form did the eating will keep the eaten Life-Form on their Reference Card.

*When a Bot player’s Life-Forms eat other Life-Forms, put them on the Fossil area on the Bot player’s Reference Card.*

*Life-Forms are also able eat Life-Forms of the same color. They are required to do so, if given the opportunity.*

*If your Life-Forms are eaten by your own Life Forms, return them to your Reincarnation Pool instead of putting them on your Reference Card. They may return to the Planet with the Sun or Rainbow on a future turn.*

Water will expand all the way to the edge of the Planet Carousel when Land Tiles of Stone and Sand stack on other Tiles throughout the game. Whenever an exposed Water edge is under the Moon’s position, Eating occurs in the Water.

Eating also occurs instantly when a player uses the Sun or Rainbow to add Life Forms into the Water when it is under the Moon-- or, when a player uses the Storm to move Life Forms into the Water when it is under the Moon, or out of the Water onto a Land Tile under the Moon.

Examples:

*At the start of the turn, the Yellow player rolls the die and gets a two.*

*On the first rotation step, a Land Tile rotates into position under the Moon. It has a Green CarniVore, a White HerbiVore, and a Yellow Plant. The White player is awarded the Yellow Plant, and the Green player is awarded the White HerbiVore. These go into their Fossils (scoring areas).*

*On the second rotation step, a Land Tile rotates into position under the Moon, which has a Yellow CarniVore and a Yellow Plant. CarniVores do not eat Plants, so nothing gets eaten here.*

*Yellow chooses to spend a Star to rotate the planet one more step. On this rotation step, there is no Land Tile that rotates into position under the Moon; instead, what rotates under the Moon is the bare surface of the Planet Carousel, which is Water. So, eating occurs in the Water. There is a Yellow HerbiVore and a Green Plant in the Water. Yellow is awarded the Green Plant. These go into their Fossils (scoring areas).*

*Yellow activates Storm. The Storm is over a Land Tile with a Yellow CarniVore and a White Plant. Yellow moves them both of them into the Water. This instantly results in eating, because the Moon is over the Water. The Yellow HerbiVore (which as you recall, just got done eating the Green Plant in the last step) awards the White Plant to Yellow. Then the Yellow CarniVore eats the Yellow HerbiVore.*

*This returns the Yellow HerbiVore to Yellow. Because it is Yellow’s own color, it is returned to its reincarnation pool, not awarded as points in Yellow’s Fossils. A Fossil area is only for keeping one’s opponents’ Life Forms, not one’s own.*

## SCORING

The game is over when the last Tile is added to the Planet.

To get your score,

- You get one point for each of your opponents’ Life-Forms on your Reference Card. (They are there because your Life-Forms ate them or you dropped a Land Tile on them.)

- Each of your Life-Forms alive on the Planet is worth one point for each Tile under it, including the Planet Carousel itself. So each one on the Water is worth one point, each one on Stone is worth two points, etc.

Example:

*Amy has a CarniVore, a HerbiVore, and a Plant on a stack of Snow/Grass/Sand/Stone/Water. Those five layers mean each Life-form is worth five points, for a total of fifteen points.*

The winner is the player with the highest score. Ties are broken in favor of the player with the most Life-Forms on the Planet.
